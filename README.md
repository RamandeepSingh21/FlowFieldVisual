# FlowFieldVisual
A very simple implementation of Perlin-like noise used to create organic 2D noise. The noise is used to create a force field.
Particles are spawned randomly and are allowed to follow the flow of the field leaving behind trails creating visuals.

# Steps :
1. Run the server.js using node.
2. Go to localhost:3000/ on the browser.
3. A new pattern everytime the page is refreshed.

...Or just run the index.html
